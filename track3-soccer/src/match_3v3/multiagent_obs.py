"""Multi-agent observation features for 3v3 — pure numpy, CPU-testable.

The single-agent hierarchical policy uses a 19-dim observation that contains
only *ball + self*. For 3v3 it must also see teammates and opponents. This
module computes the extra per-player features as a pure function so they can be
unit-tested without Genesis, then concatenated onto the 19-dim base.

Extra features (5 dims), all in the robot body frame:

    nearest_teammate_rel(2)   — xy of the closest teammate relative to self
    nearest_opponent_rel(2)   — xy of the closest opponent relative to self
    possession_flag(1)        — +1 if my team possesses, -1 if opponents, 0 loose

Total observation becomes 19 + 5 = 24 dims. These are appended *after* the base
19 so a policy trained without them is untouched (feature flag off), and a new
policy can be trained with them on (feature flag on).
