"""3v3 soccer match environment — scene, roles, policies, and evaluation.

This package defines the code skeleton for 6-robot (3v3) soccer matches.
It does NOT require Genesis or GPU for import or unit-level testing.

Modules:
    scene   — Scene3v3: builds 6 T1 entities + ball + goals, holds entity handles.
    roles   — RoleAssigner: attacker/defender/goalkeeper assignment via fixed rules.
    policy  — RulePolicy and SharedRLPolicy with a unified action interface.
