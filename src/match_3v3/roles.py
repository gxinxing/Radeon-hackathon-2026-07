"""Role assignment for 3v3 soccer.

Assigns attacker / defender / goalkeeper per team using fixed, explainable rules:
    1. Closest player to ball → ATTACKER
    2. Of remaining players, closest to own goal → GOALKEEPER
    3. Remaining player → DEFENDER

Each assignment includes a target position derived from the role and match state.
Reassignment happens at a configurable interval to allow dynamic role switching.
