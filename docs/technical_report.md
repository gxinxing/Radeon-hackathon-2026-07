**Application Name**: Hierarchical Soccer Policy with Reward-Guided Kicking on AMD ROCm
**Submission Date**: August 2026

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Objective

Train humanoid robot soccer policies (balance, chase, shoot) using the Genesis physics
engine and ROCm PyTorch on AMD Radeon GPUs, then validate via distributed 3v3 matches
in Genesis — entirely on AMD hardware, with no NVIDIA dependencies.

Booster Robotics' official RL training frameworks (Booster Gym / Booster Train) depend on
NVIDIA Isaac Gym and Isaac Lab, which require CUDA. This project builds an alternative
training pipeline that runs **entirely on AMD Radeon GPUs**, proving that competitive
humanoid robot policies can be trained without NVIDIA hardware.

### 1.2 Key Contributions

1. **First AMD-GPU humanoid soccer training pipeline** — Genesis + ROCm PyTorch + rsl_rl
   as a complete Isaac Gym alternative, achieving 4,618 steps/s on AMD Radeon (51 GB VRAM)
2. **Reward function engineering for kicking behavior** — Identified and fixed the
   "ball contact punishment" bug (approach_ball hard-clamped → tanh soft clamp), added
   approach_angle and directed_contact rewards to shape contact direction, achieving
   1,358 goals in 500 iterations (830% improvement over v7)
3. **Hierarchical policy architecture** — Frozen t1_walk.pt (720→21) for locomotion +
   trainable high-level PPO (19→3) for soccer behavior, with curriculum-based action
   clip scheduling
4. **Floating-base dynamics fix** — 5 critical bugs in Genesis URDF loading, state
   reading, and termination logic identified and fixed
5. **Distributed multi-robot architecture** — Socket-coordinated multi-process system
   bypassing Genesis ROCm multi-entity crash, enabling 3v3 matches with 6 concurrent
   robots on a single AMD GPU

### 2.2 Hierarchical Policy Design

| Level | Observation | Action | Frequency | Model |
|-------|------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| High-level | 19-dim (ball pos/vel, goal dir, proprioception) | 3-dim (vx, vy, wz) | 10 Hz | Trainable PPO |
| Low-level | 720-dim (10-frame proprioception history) | 21-dim (joint targets) | 50 Hz | Frozen t1_walk.pt |

The high-level policy observes ball position, velocity, and goal direction in body frame.
It outputs velocity commands (vx, vy, wz) that are injected into the frozen walking
model's observation. This design solves a fundamental problem: the original flat policy
(720-dim obs) had no ball information but was rewarded for approaching the ball.

### 2.3 19-dim Observation Space

| Index | Component | Dims | Description |
|-------|-----------|------|-------------|
| 0-2 | filtered_lin_vel | 3 | Robot velocity in body frame |
| 3-5 | filtered_ang_vel | 3 | Robot angular velocity in body frame |
| 6-7 | projected_gravity | 2 | Orientation indicator (xy) |
| 8-9 | ball_rel_body | 2 | Ball position relative to robot, body frame |
| 10-11 | ball_vel_body | 2 | Ball velocity in body frame |
| 12 | dist_to_ball | 1 | Euclidean distance to ball |
| 13-14 | goal_dir | 2 | Goal direction in body frame (normalized) |
| 15 | goal_dist | 1 | Distance to goal |
| 16-18 | last_hl_actions | 3 | Last velocity command [vx, vy, wz] |

## 4. Reward Function Design

### 4.1 The Ball Contact Problem

The original reward function had a critical flaw: `r_approach_ball` used a hard clamp
(`torch.clamp(prev_dist - dist, min=0.0)`). This meant:

- Robot approaches ball → distance decreases → **positive reward** ✓
- Robot contacts ball, ball bounces away → distance increases → **reward = 0** (clamped)

The robot learned to camp at 0.25m and never touch the ball. Two additional problems
compounded this:

1. **No approach angle reward** — the robot was rewarded for reaching the ball regardless
   of which direction it approached from. If it approached from the goal side, contact
   pushed the ball the wrong way.
2. **Weak ball_to_goal signal** — weight was only 3.0 vs approach_ball's 10.0, so
   "push ball toward goal" was a weaker signal than "walk toward ball."

### 4.2 Reward Function Fixes (v8)

| Change | Before | After | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| `approach_ball` | `torch.clamp(Δ, min=0.0)` | `torch.tanh(Δ)` | Soft clamp preserves weak gradient on bad contact |
| `approach_angle` (new) | — | weight: 3.0 | Reward approaching ball from goal-opposite side |
| `directed_contact` (new) | — | weight: 5.0 | Bonus for foot-near-ball WHILE ball moves toward goal |
| `ball_to_goal` | 3.0 | 8.0 | Make "push ball toward goal" signal comparable to "chase ball" |
| `hl_clip_lin` | 0.8 m/s | 1.2 m/s | Unlock higher walking speed for stronger ball contact |

### 4.3 Complete Reward Function (v8)

| Reward Term | Weight | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| upright | 0.5 | Torso upright indicator |
| alive | 0.0 | Removed (caused local optimum) |
| orientation | -1.0 | Penalize tilted orientation |
| approach_ball | 10.0 | Distance decrease to ball (tanh soft-clamped) |
| approach_angle | 3.0 | Dot product of ball direction and goal direction |
| ball_control | 2.0 | Close to ball (exp kernel) |
| ball_progress | 10.0 | Potential-based: ball-to-goal distance reduction |
| ball_contact | 1.0 | Foot within 0.15m of ball |
| directed_contact | 5.0 | Foot near ball AND ball moving toward goal |
| ball_to_goal | 8.0 | Ball velocity component toward goal |
| goal_scored | 30.0 | Ball crosses goal line (episode resets) |
| fall_penalty | -5.0 | Robot fallen |
| recovery_bonus | 3.0 | Robot recovered from fallen state |
| action_rate | -1.0 | Penalize jerky command changes |
| energy_penalty | -0.01 | Action squared sum |
| lin_vel_z | -0.5 | Penalize vertical oscillation |
| ang_vel_xy | -0.1 | Penalize roll/pitch rotation |

### 4.4 Approach Angle Reward

```python
def r_approach_angle(ball_rel_body, goal_dir_body):
    ball_dir = ball_rel_body / (norm(ball_rel_body) + 1e-6)
    return dot(ball_dir, goal_dir_body)
```

When the robot is between the ball and its own goal (approaching from behind the ball),
this returns +1. When it's in front of the ball (goal side), it returns -1. This shapes
the approach trajectory so that contact naturally pushes the ball toward the goal.

### 4.5 Directed Contact Reward

```python
def r_directed_contact(min_foot_dist, ball_vel_to_goal, contact_radius=0.20):
    in_contact = (min_foot_dist < contact_radius).float()
    good_direction = clamp(ball_vel_to_goal, min=0.0)
    return in_contact * good_direction
```

This only fires when both conditions are met: foot within contact radius AND ball has
positive velocity toward goal. The robot gets rewarded for *how* it touches, not just
*that* it touches.

| Falls | — | 0 | — | Zero falls |

### 5.3 v7 vs v8 Comparison

| Metric | v7 (old reward) | v8 (new reward) | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Peak reward | +21.69 | +105.61 | ▲387% |
| Total goals | 146 | 1,358 | ▲830% |

| Episode length | 225 | 220 | Comparable |
| Action std | 0.07 | 0.08 | Healthy exploration |

### 5.4 Reward Function Impact

The reward function changes had the most dramatic impact on goal-scoring behavior:

```
v7 (hard clamp, no angle/contact shaping):
  approach_ball: clamp(Δ, min=0) → robot camps at 0.25m, never touches ball
  ball_to_goal: weight 3.0 → too weak to overcome camping local optimum
  Result: 146 goals in 500 iterations (mostly lucky bounces)

v8 (tanh clamp + angle + directed contact):
  approach_ball: tanh(Δ) → weak negative gradient on bad contact
  approach_angle: dot(ball_dir, goal_dir) → robot learns to approach from behind
  directed_contact: in_contact × ball_vel_to_goal → rewards good kicks
  ball_to_goal: weight 8.0 → strong enough to dominate contact behavior
  Result: 1,358 goals in 500 iterations (9.3× improvement)
```

## 7. Distributed 3v3 Match Validation

### 7.1 Genesis ROCm Multi-Entity Crash

Genesis on AMD ROCm crashes with `hipErrorLaunchFailure` when two or more humanoid robots
with floating bases are loaded in the same scene (VRAM usage only 0.9 GB / 51.5 GB — not a
memory issue). This is a platform-level bug in Genesis + ROCm multi-articulated-body
collision handling.

### 7.2 Distributed Multi-Process Architecture

Each robot runs in its own Genesis process (proven stable with 1 robot). A socket-based
coordinator synchronizes state between processes at 50 Hz:

```

### 7.3 3v3 Match Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Match duration | 25.0s |
| Total steps logged | 1,240 |
| Robots | 6 (3 RL + 3 rule-based) |
| Collisions | 7 (in first 6.3s) |
| Ball displacement | 4.77m max (active play) |
| Zero GPU crashes | ✓ |

### 7.4 RL vs Rule-Based Behavior

Team A (RL) robots showed autonomous ball-chasing behavior:
- RL attacker moved 3.06m across the field toward the ball
- RL robots maintained balance (pitch < 7° throughout)
- Ball was actively displaced to both sides of the field

Team B (rule-based) robots showed simpler chase behavior:
- Rule attacker reached ball distance of 0.13m
- Less coordinated movement across the field

## 8. ONNX Model Export

### 8.1 Export Method

The ONNX model was exported via raw MLP weight extraction from the rsl_rl checkpoint:

```python
# Extract actor weights from checkpoint
ckpt = torch.load('model_499.pt')
sd = ckpt['actor_state_dict']

# Build standalone MLP (weights inlined)
mlp = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(19, 256), nn.ELU(),
    nn.Linear(256, 128), nn.ELU(),
    nn.Linear(128, 64), nn.ELU(),
    nn.Linear(64, 3),
)
mlp.load_state_dict({k: sd[v] for k, v in mapping.items()})

# Export with weights inlined (not external .data file)
torch.onnx.export(mlp, dummy_obs, 'chase_v8_policy.onnx', opset_version=17)
```

### 8.2 ONNX Model Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| File | `models/chase_v8_policy.onnx` |
| Input | `obs` [batch, 19] |
| Output | `action` [batch, 3] (vx, vy, wz) |

## 9. Floating-Base Dynamics Fix

### 9.1 Problem

The original Genesis simulation had the robot's floating base (6-DoF) locked — the
robot's trunk position never changed under gravity, making all prior training results
invalid. Five root-cause bugs were identified:

### 9.2 Five Bug Fixes

| # | Bug | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|-----|-----------|-----|
| 1 | Floating base lock | URDF `world_joint` commented out + `merge_fixed_links=True` | Uncomment + `merge_fixed_links=False` |
| 2 | 1-step termination | `base_euler` in degrees, `term_pitch` in radians (0.52° vs 30°) | Use degree values directly |
| 3 | Obs history misalignment | `_build_low_level_obs` updated history before physics step | Read `obs_buf` only, update after step |
| 4 | Conservative local optimum | `approach_ball=1` → standing still gives +34 reward | Curriculum + `approach_ball=10` |
| 5 | Action std explosion | `entropy_coef=0.01` → std=5.78, noise dominates | `entropy_coef=0.003` → std=0.07 |

## 11. Known Limitations

1. **Close-range ball control**: When the ball is within ~2m, the velocity-command
   interface cannot express fine motor adjustments needed for ball possession. A residual
   joint-level policy would be needed for dribbling and precise shooting.

2. **Genesis ROCm multi-entity crash**: Genesis on AMD ROCm crashes with
   `hipErrorLaunchFailure` when two or more robot URDF entities are loaded in the same
   scene. The distributed multi-process architecture works around this but adds
   communication overhead.

3. **3v3 match rendering**: The distributed match produces JSON trajectory data, not
   real-time 3D video. A 2D top-down animation renderer (`render_match.py`) visualizes
   the match from trajectory logs.

## 13. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the first complete humanoid robot soccer training pipeline on
AMD Radeon GPUs using Genesis + ROCm PyTorch. The reward function engineering was the
key breakthrough: by replacing the hard clamp with tanh soft clamp and adding
approach_angle + directed_contact rewards, the robot learned to approach the ball from
the correct direction and make contact that pushes the ball toward the goal, achieving
1,358 goals in 500 iterations (830% improvement over the previous best).

The distributed multi-process architecture enabled 3v3 matches with 6 concurrent robots
on a single AMD GPU, validating the trained policies in a multi-agent setting. All
engineering deliverables — benchmark data, ONNX deployment model, demo videos, match
logs, and reproducible code — are archived on GitHub.
